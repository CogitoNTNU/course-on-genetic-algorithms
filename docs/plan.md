## Course Outline: Introduction to NEAT and Genetic Algorithms

## 1. Welcome and Course Overview (5 minutes)

### Objectives of the course
-[] Understand the basics of genetic algorithms and NEAT.
-[] Implement and experiment with NEAT in Jupyter Notebook.
-[] Structure: Presentation + hands-on coding.

## 2. Introduction to Genetic Algorithms (10 minutes)

### Presentation Topics:

### What is a Genetic Algorithm?
        Definition and analogy to natural selection.
        Key concepts: population, fitness, selection, crossover, mutation.
### Why Use Genetic Algorithms?
        Advantages: heuristic search, exploration of complex solution spaces.
        Applications: optimization, scheduling, game AI, neural network training.
### Applications Overview:
        Examples: evolving images, DALL-E style creativity (brief touch), game strategies.
        Showcases: GIFs of CrawlAI, NEAT Tactics.

### Activity (5 min):
        Discuss in groups where genetic algorithms can be useful


## 3. Introduction to NEAT (20 minutes)

## Presentation Topics:

-[] What is NEAT?
        Basics: evolving neural networks.
        Comparison to standard genetic algorithms.
        Benefits of NEAT: preserving innovation, speciation.

-[] Key Concepts of NEAT:
        - Genome representation: nodes, connections, weights.
        - Input and output in environment
        - Fitness
        - Mutation types: weight mutation, adding nodes, adding connections.
        - Speciation: maintaining diversity in the population.
        - Crossover


### Activity/ short break
Discuss the key concepts in Neat in pairs.
- How would you calculate a fitness function?
- Why do we use speciation?
- What are the different types of mutations?
- How do you do crossover?
